# sql_to_morrisjs


This is a small bootstrap based website that converts data from an sql database to morrisjs charts. 

I had a hard time finding out how MorrisJS takes data from an SQL data base and displays in a line chart. 

Just two things for now. 

1. The collect_data.php file connects to a database, please put in your own configuration. 
2. The SQL queries in collect_data.php are specific to my own database so these should be changed to suit your own configuration.

Let me know if you have any questions related to how this works.
